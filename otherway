This is a strange way to test the same thing.
Compose is much better, but this work too.

First of all, create a network to both containers:
docker create network visitapp

Then, create a redis container at the network created before:
docker run -d --rm --name redis-app --network visitapp redis

So, build your Dockerfile:
docker build -t nodeapp .

And run:
docker run -p 4040:8081 --rm --name visitnode --network visitapp nodeapp
